What is a high-quality digital book&nbsp;? How do I make good decisions and take all&nbsp; users into account? How do I maintain, sort and prioritize issues of performance, interoperability, accessibility, eco-design, security and personal data management&nbsp;?

Qualebook provides answers and methodology for existing teams as well as for people who wish to develop or invest in digital editing projects.

The quality control checklists for digital books have&#8239; the following objectives:

- The quality control checklists for digital books have&#8239; the following objectives:
- bathe a common referential of quality of the digital book
- facilitate ownership by professionals and give meaning to the actions taken.

## Work in progress

The first version of Qualebook was prepared in 2024 by EDRLab and the Standards & Standards Group of the National Syndicat Digital Commission’s (NES).

The year 2025 is dedicated to confronting this list with the schedules of professional teams at the workshop course

## Authors

Qualebook is developed by the European Laboratory for Digital Reading ([edrlab.org](https://www.edrlab.org/about/)) in partnership with the <span lang="fr">Standard & Standards Group of the [National Publishing Union Numbering Commission](https://www.sne.fr/numerique-2/). </span>

## Why&nbsp; Qualebook?

By entering the age of maturity, the digital edition has developed industrialization processes of a new type for an essentially "paper" industry. The standardization of a digital book distribution format was obtained by the development of the EPUB format. Then came the industrialization of digital reading software, with the appearance of initiatives such as the Readium project. The current distribution of the digital rights management technology LCP also participates in this standardization movement.

Issue numbering is now also subject to external injunctions linked to equal and societal provisions, which are not equally meticulous by the players in the sector.

Pour que leur production numérique reste rentable tout en répondant aux attentes des publics et des financeurs, les maisons d'édition doivent acquérir des compétences variées, qui ne peuvent se limiter à la typographie&nbsp;: la performance, l’interopérabilité, l'accessibilité, l'éco-conception, la sécurité ou la gestion des données personnelles doivent également être maitrisées par ces équipes. Good coordination of these expertise is also impeded.

This growing complexity of the digital publishing regulatory framework also has the side effect of further distancing the business from editing and editors, thus creating gaps and misunderstandings between the design, production, distribution and management teams.

This creates difficulties for the publishing sector in terms of decision making, risk management, training, metrics, means and governance.

In the industrialized sectors, quality insurance, quality management, quality control, certifications, qualifications, methods, techniques and training are common. The digital publishing sector is now ready to use these tools to adopt and integrate external expertise.
