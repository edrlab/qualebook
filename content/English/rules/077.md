objectif:
  - Allow users of assistive technologies to navigate table content easily.
  - Improve content accessibility for users with disabilities.
Meo:
  - Ensure that cell content remains understandable when linearized. Assistive technologies read and announce table cells (<th> and <td>) and rows (<tr>) sequentially, so the logical reading order must be preserved.
Controle:
  - Inspect the HTML source code of the EPUB to verify that the linear reading order of layout tables is logical.
