title: "Informative images have a text alternative"
abstract: "Informative images may include illustrations (paintings, drawings, photos, comics, maps, timelines, labels...), charts, or data tables. In other words, they provide both essential and complementary information about adjacent textual content. In this case, these images must be accompanied by a description."

objectif:
  - "Allow readers placed in contexts where images are not perceptible (synthetic voice, screen reader, immersive reading) to understand the meaning of images that they cannot see."
Meo:
  - "Give each img element related to an alt attribute reproducing the information, a link next to the image playing the same role: in the content of the page, in the context of the image. In the latter case, the alternative can report the presence of this description and return it."
Contrôle:
  - "Check that the alt attribute of each img element concerned reproduces the information carried by the image."
  - "Check the presence and relevance of the extended description if applicable."
  - "Verify that the content remains understandable in the absence of the image."
