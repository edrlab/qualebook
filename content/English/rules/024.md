title: "Informative images include a text alternative"
abstract: "Informative images include illustrations (paintings, drawings, photos, comics, maps, timelines, labels, etc.) as well as charts, diagrams, infographics, and data tables. These images convey information that is either essential or complementary to the surrounding text. Consequently, these images must be accompanied by a description."

objectif:
  - Enable users in situations where images are not perceptible (speech synthesis, screen readers, immersive reading) to understand the meaning of images they cannot see.
Meo:
  - Provide each relevant `img` element with an `alt` attribute that conveys the same information, or provide an adjacent link that serves the same purpose within the immediate context of the image. In the latter case, the text alternative may indicate the presence of this description and link to it.
Contrôle:
  - "Check that the alt attribute of each img element concerned reproduces the information carried by the image."
  - "Check the presence and relevance of the extended description if applicable."
  - "Verify that the content remains understandable in the absence of the image."
