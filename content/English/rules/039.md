  - Prevent potential confusion regarding the purpose of links.

  - Improve content accessibility for users with disabilities.
Meo:
  - Provide a text label for every link between the opening and closing <a> tags or, if necessary, via the text alternative of an <img> or <object> element. Do not hide the text label from display to replace it with CSS styles like background images.
Controle:
  - Identify all links.
  - Check that every text-based link contains readable text, even when styles (color, formatting) are disabled.
  - Verify that every link consisting solely of an image or equivalent content provides a clear text alternative, even when styles are disabled.
