objectif:
  - "Prevent possible incomprehension of links."
  - "Avoid links that become invisible when CSS styles or background images are not included."
  - "Improve accessibility of content to readers with disabilities"
Meo:
  - "Give each link a text label (between the opening and closing tags of the `a` element) or, if necessary, via the text alternative of an `img` or `object` element. Do not hide the text label of the element to replace it with a CSS style effect (background image)."
Controle:
  - Find all links in the content.
  - Verify that each text link contains readable text, even if styles are disabled (no color, no formatting).
  - Verify that each link consisting solely of an image (or equivalent content) has understandable alternative text, even if styles are disabled.
