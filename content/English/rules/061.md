title: The size of the clickable elements is sufficient.
abstract: Touch screens brought their batch of constraints. Of these, the ability to click with your fingers is not the least. International standards for accessibility of Web content to readers with disabilities even set a numerical value for the minimum size of clickable elements. As with contrasts, this allows us to propose a pattern based on the existence of this numeric value.
