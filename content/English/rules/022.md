title: Each decorative image is tagged as such
abstract: Digital book playback devices often allow synthetic voice rendering and some disabled users use screen readers to obtain alternative audio or touch rendering. In both cases, textual alternatives to images are rendered, which may disturb understanding or become irritating in the case of decorative images. In order to avoid increasing playback, it is necessary to correctly fill in the decorative function.
