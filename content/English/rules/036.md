title: "The source code of each content document identifies its primary language"
abstract: "Screen readers and braille displays may not automatically detect a book's primary language. Providing this information in the source code for each section ensures the content is processed and rendered correctly."

objectif:
  - Ensure screen readers use the correct pronunciation for the content.
  - Facilitate automatic translation.
  - Improve content indexing based on language.
Meo:
  - Add the `lang` attribute to the root `html` element of the Content Document to specify the primary language of the text.
  - Ensure the language code complies with the IANA Language Subtag Registry. In practice, for English, use `lang="en"` in HTML or both `lang="en"` and `xml:lang="en"` in XHTML. If the language varies within the book, use the `lang` attribute (and `xml:lang` for XHTML) on specific elements to indicate language shifts within a section.
  - Apply the `lang` attribute to elements such as `p`, `div`, or `span` to signal passages in a different language (e.g., `<p lang="fr">`). If the primary language changes across different parts of the content, define the `lang` attribute (or `xml:lang` for XHTML) on parent elements like `head`, `body`, or `title` to specify the dominant language for those sections.
Controle:
  - Check that the root `html` element of the Content Document includes the `lang` attribute (e.g., `lang="en"`) and, for XHTML, the `xml:lang` attribute to indicate the primary language.
  - Ensure the `xml:lang` attribute is present in XHTML documents to maintain compatibility with legacy systems and tools requiring this specification.
  - Verify that the `lang` attribute is used on relevant elements (e.g., `p`, `div`, `span`) for any multilingual content to indicate language changes within the document.
  - Confirm that the language for metadata and content in sections such as `head`, `title`, and `body` is explicitly defined with the `lang` attribute to ensure linguistic consistency.
  - Verify that language codes comply with the IANA Language Subtag Registry and match the content's language. Note that generic codes like `mul` (multiple languages) and `und` (undetermined) must not be used. Additionally, while `xml:lang` can supplement the `lang` attribute, it is not sufficient on its own to meet this requirement.
