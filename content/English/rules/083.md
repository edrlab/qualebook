title: "Metadata specifies whether the full content is accessible via text or audio"
abstract: "Metadata must explicitly indicate if the content is fully accessible through alternative modes (textual or auditory). This helps blind users using assistive technologies or individuals using text-to-speech features to determine if the book meets their reading needs."

objectif:
  - Allow users to determine available reading modes in advance.
  - Minimize the risk of customer complaints and returns.
Meo:
  - Provide metadata regarding non-visual reading and any pre-recorded audio content. This information must be included in both the ebook metadata and the corresponding ONIX record.
  - In EPUB, use the `accessModeSufficient` property with the values `textual` or `auditory`. Depending on the book's specific content, it may also be necessary to include `accessibilityFeature` with values such as `alternativeText`, `longDescription`, `describedMath`, or `transcript`.
  - 'In ONIX, use one or more of the following codes: List 196 code 52; List 81 codes 01 and 10; as well as codes for specific content if present: List 196 codes 14, 15, 16, and List 175 code V212.'
  - If applicable, add this information to other metadata schemas being used. A reference crosswalk table is available in English for this purpose.
Controle:
  - Verify the presence and accuracy of the `accessModeSufficient` and `accessibilityFeature` metadata within the EPUB.
  - 'Verify the presence and accuracy of the following codes in the ONIX record: List 196 code 52; List 81 codes 01 and 10; and codes for specific content if present (List 196 codes 14, 15, 16; List 175 code V212).'
