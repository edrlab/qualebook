title: Each graph is accompanied by its numerical data
abstract: An image is often better than a long speech. Yes, but first of all, it may have been difficult to understand a graph (curve, diagram, histogram, pipe...) if we do not have the data that has been used to create it. On the other hand, some users will not be able to access the graphical rendering, and access to the data will allow them to understand the content.
