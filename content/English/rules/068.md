title: "JavaScript files are minified"
abstract: "Minification consists of minimizing the amount of data and thus the weight of the bearer file by removing the elements unnecessary for the reading system (typically, spaces, line breaks and comments). JavaScript files can thus be minified. Minified JavaScript files save a few kilobytes of data, making them load faster and saving the energy needed to transfer and display them."
