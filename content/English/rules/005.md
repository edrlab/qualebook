Meo:
  - "At the first occurrence of an abbreviation or acronym in a book or chapter, provide its expanded form to define its meaning. This can be done directly in the text, for example by writing “a DTD (document type declaration)”. You can also provide a link to a glossary page or a tooltip which gives the definition. It is also possible to use the HTML element `<abbr>` with the `title` attribute to indicate its meaning. This only applies to the first occurrence of the term."
Controle:
  - "For each page, visually identify the acronyms, abbreviations and acronyms. Check that the first time they occur, their full meaning is indicated. Several methods are possible: directly in the text (for example, in parentheses), by a link on the term referring to its definition (like in a glossary), or via the HTML element `<abbr>` with the `title attribute`."
