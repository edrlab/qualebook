title: "Typographic pictograms are provided with a suitable alternative"
abstract: "The use of web fonts (downloadable character fonts) has greatly facilitated the use of a very popular technical trick from a performance point of view: replacing the images of various icons with a graphic UTF-8 character obtained using a specific font. However, this involves significant risks, including accessibility risks, if you do not make sure that a textual alternative is created to this character that was stunned from its meaning by default."
