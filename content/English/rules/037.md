title: "The main language of the target page of a link is identifiable when it differs from that of the original page"
abstract: "Unexpectedly landing in a section written in a Ñoldor Elvish dialect when you do not speak the language is never a pleasant surprise. In a digital book, it is important to provide clear information so that the reader knows what to expect when clicking a link, whether internal or external. Identifying the language of the target section or content in advance prevents surprises and improves the reading experience. And specifying the language of linked sections helps limit unnecessary or frustrating clicks for readers."
