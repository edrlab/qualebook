title: The main language of the target page of a link is identifiable when it differs from that of the original page
detail: null
abstract: Arriving by surprise on a dialect section of the N<unk> oldor Elves when not speaking their language is never pleasant. In a digital book, it is important to provide clear information so that the reader knows what to expect when clicking a link, whether internal or external. Identifying in advance the language of the section or of the target content helps to avoid surprises and improve the reading experience. Specifying the language of the sections in the links helps limit unnecessary or frustrating clicks for readers.

objectif:
  - Allow readers and players, including voice synth tools, to anticipate a change of language when navigating through a digital book.
  - Avoid readers accessing a section or content they don't understand the language, clearly indicating the target language in advance.
Meo:
  - "The target language of a link can be specified in several ways&nbsp;: <ul><li>via the link libelate, edited in target language, which allows the reader to anticipate the change of language</li><li>Possibly using an appropriate icoen, such as a symbol or visual indicator (like a flag), although the use of icoen is less common in numeric books and may depend on the layout context.</li><li> Possibly explicit in the link libellee or in its immeditative context, by clearly mentioning the target language directly in the text or information around the link.</li></ul>"
Controle:
  - Manually identify links where the content of the target section or document is not written in the same language as the current section.
  - Check, for each of these links, that the reader is immeditated informed of the language of the target content, either through the link label (written in the target language), either by an appropriate visual indicator, or by an explicit indication in the context of the link.
