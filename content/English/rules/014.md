title: "Include an accessibility summary in the metadata when necessary"
abstract: "Accessibility metadata helps readers determine if an ebook meets their specific needs before purchase. Since standard metadata properties may not always fully capture all accessibility features or potential limitations, a dedicated summary field allows for a concise description to provide context not covered by other specific metadata values."
