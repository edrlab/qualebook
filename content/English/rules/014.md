title: "If necessary, additional accessibility information is available in metadata"
abstract: "Accessibility metadata allows users to assess whether a digital book meets their specific needs before purchasing it. In specific circumstances, accessibility metadata may not completely reflect your efforts or potential limitations. In this case, a specific field allows you to directly write a short text describing what is not represented by other metadata."
