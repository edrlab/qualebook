title: "Scientific formulas are provided in the appropriate markup language (MathML, ChemML, etc.) "
abstract: You know what is worse than a complex scientific formula&nbsp;? A complex scientific formula that is not tagged correctly&nbsp;! Imagine a math teacher trying to read an equation that looks like an Egyptian precedent. To avoid this type of disaster, it is recommended to use tagged languages such as MathML or ChemML. Thus, even the more complicated formulas will be as readable as a children's storybook. Alors, faites plaisir à vos lecteurs et à vos systèmes de lecture, et adoptez les bonnes balises&nbsp;!
