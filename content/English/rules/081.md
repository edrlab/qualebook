title: "Scientific formulas are provided in the appropriate markup language (MathML, ChemML, etc.) "
abstract: "Complex scientific formulas must display correctly regardless of user preferences (such as dark mode, font size, etc.). To ensure this flexibility, use the appropriate markup language rather than static images. This good practice will also facilitate the extraction and re-use of these formulas, including through assistive technologies."
