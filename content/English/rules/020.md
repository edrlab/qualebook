title: "Chapters and book sections are identified using ARIA roles and EPUB types"
abstract: "While chapters are visually distinguished through styling, assistive technology users require programmatic identification of these structures. Using ARIA roles and EPUB types ensures that navigation and semantic meaning are preserved. This semantic structure also facilitates future content updates and maintenance."
