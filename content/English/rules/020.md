title: Chapters and other parts of the book are programmatically identified with ARIA Role and EPUB types
abstract: Clearly identify different content sections and portions with ARIA roles allows users of support technologies as screen readers, navigate more easily and understand the structure of the book. By doubling the corresponding EPUB Types, this ensures that all playback systems will be able to use this information. This is also useful information on the day when you want to update your content or publish it in a more recent or different format.
