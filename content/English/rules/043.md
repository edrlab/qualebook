Meo:
  - "Hyperlinks can be differentiated using CSS properties such as text color, background color, underlining, bold, borders, font, etc."
Controle:
  - In each section or chapter, identify all links in the text.
  - Ensure that these links are clearly distinguished from the rest of the text (for example, by color, underlining, or another visual effect).
  - When links are differentiated solely by color, verify that this difference is sufficiently noticeable and that an additional effect (such as a visual change) appears when hovering over the link or when the link receives keyboard focus.
