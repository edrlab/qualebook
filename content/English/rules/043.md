objectif:
  - Enable users to easily identify links within the text flow.

  - Enhance content accessibility for people with disabilities.
Meo:
  - Differentiate hyperlinks using CSS properties such as text color, background color, underlines, bold weight, borders, or font changes.
Controle:
  - Identify all links within the text of each section or chapter.
  - Check that these links are clearly distinct from the surrounding text (e.g., through color, underlining, or other visual effects).
  - If links are differentiated by color alone, ensure the contrast difference is sufficient to be perceivable and that an additional visual cue appears on hover or keyboard focus.
