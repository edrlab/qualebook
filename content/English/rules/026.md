title: "The included objects are provided with an appropriate fallback alternative. "
abstract: "Some digital books contain non-native interactive or scripted elements like Canvas, iframes or widgets that may not be supported by reading devices. To prevent these elements from disappearing or displaying incorrectly, it is necessary to provide fallback content that conveys the information to the reader."
