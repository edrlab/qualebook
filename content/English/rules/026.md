title: "Embedded elements provide appropriate fallbacks"
abstract: "Some ebooks contain non-native interactive or scripted elements—such as canvas, iframes, or widgets—that may not be supported by all reading systems. Providing fallback content prevents these elements from disappearing or rendering incorrectly."

objectif:
  - Ensure access to information for users whose reading systems do not support specific technologies.
  - Improve content accessibility for people with disabilities.
Meo:
  - Provide fallback content for specific elements (including form interactions or external resources) so they can be rendered as a replacement if the reading system cannot display them.
  - For EPUB files, link fallback content within the spine or within the specific elements they represent.
Controle:
  - Check that the ebook remains readable and usable on legacy reading systems or when JavaScript is disabled.
  - Verify that 'object' or 'canvas' elements are either not essential for understanding or have a text alternative.
