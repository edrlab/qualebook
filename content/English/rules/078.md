title: "Data tables are provided in HTML format"
abstract: "To remain usable and accessible, data tables must be constructed using semantic HTML tags rather than inserted as images or simulated using text separators like spaces or tabs. For large or complex tables that might be poorly rendered on small screens or legacy devices, if an image is provided for visual layout, the HTML table must still be included as a long description accessible via a link."

objectif:
  - Ensure the accessibility and reusability of tabular data.
  - Guarantee that assistive technologies and search engines correctly interpret the tables.
  - Allow table rendering to adapt to different screen sizes and user reading preferences such as text size and contrast.
  - Facilitate copying, extracting, and analyzing the data within the tables.
Meo:
  - Provide structured data to the production department.
  - Use semantic HTML table tags (<table>, <caption>, <thead>, <tbody>, <tfoot>, <tr>, <th>, <td>), and associate row/column headers using <th> with scope="col" or scope="row" attributes.
  - For complex tables, use the headers attribute on <td> cells to link them to the IDs of their corresponding <th> elements.
  - 'Manage wide tables using a scrollable container by wrapping them in a div with style="overflow-x: auto" to enable horizontal scrolling.'
  - If an image of the table is included, provide a long description and make it accessible via a clear link near the image. Use the aria-details attribute on the image to reference the ID of the link or the long description section.
Controle:
  - Open the EPUB in various reading systems, resize the window or change orientation, and verify that the table remains readable, the content does not shift unexpectedly, and scrollbars appear for wide tables.
  - Verify the presence, visibility, and relevance of the table title (<caption>).
  - Attempt to copy and paste the table content to ensure it is copied as structured text rather than an image. The use of an image for data constitutes an error.
  - If a table image is present, ensure the link to the long description is visible and functional.
  - Inspect the source code of the EPUB's HTML pages.
