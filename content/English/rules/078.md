title: "Data tables are available in HTML format"
abstract: "To be usable, data tables must be correctly constructed with dedicated HTML tags and not inserted as images in digital books or simulated with textual separators (spaces, tabs, etc.). In the case of large and complex tables that might be poorly rendered by old or small reading tools, if an image of the table is provided, then the HTML table should be added as a long description accessible via a link."

objectif:
  - "Ensure accessibility and reusability of tabular data for all users and systems."
  - "Ensure correct interpretation of tables by assistive technologies and search engines."
  - "Allow the rendering of tables to be adapted to different screens and reading preferences (text size, contrast)."
  - "Facilitate the copying, extraction and analysis of data contained in tables."
Meo:
  - "Provide the manufacturing department with structured data."
  - "Use HTML tags dedicated to tables (`<table>`, `<caption>`, `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, `<tfoot>`, <tr>`, <th>`, `<td>`). Associate row/column headers using `<th>` with `scope=\"col\"` or `scope=\"row\"` attributes."
  - "For complex tables, use the headers attribute on `<td>` cells to link them to the ids of their corresponding `<th>`."
  - "Manage Wide Tables with a Scrollable Container Wrap wide tables in a `div` with `style overflow-x auto` to allow horizontal scrolling."
  - "If you include an image of a table, the full HTML table must be provided as a long description, accessible via a clear link near the image. Mark the image with an `aria-detail` attribute containing the `ID` of the link to the long description section."
Controle:
  - "Open the EPUB in several different reading tools, resize the window or change the orientation. Is the table still readable? Is the content moving correctly? Are there scrollbars for wide tables?"
  - "Check the presence of the table title (`<caption>`): Is it visible and relevant?"
  - "Try copying/pasting the contents of the table: Is the data copied as structured text or as an image? (If it's an image, that's a problem)."
  - "If a table image is present, is the link to the long description visible and functional?"
  - "Check the source code of the epub HTML page."
