  - "This verification requires a visual review of the pages to identify images containing only text and to evaluate whether a CSS formatting would have made it possible to obtain a rendering. For each page containing text displayed as images, review the images (including HTML images and CSS background images used to simulate textures like parchment or notebook paper). Make sure that the textual images correspond only to formatting that cannot be obtained through CSS styles. Are excluded from this requirement&nbsp;: logos, promotional graphics."
