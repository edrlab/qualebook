title: "The ebook specifies its text and data mining (TDM) and usage rights."
abstract: "Text and Data Mining (TDM) is used by both private and public entities to analyze large volumes of data, including copyrighted content like ebooks. Because these techniques are subject to legal conditions, mass processing requires a way to quickly identify works where TDM is restricted or prohibited by rights holders."

  - Follow the [TDM Reservation Protocol (TDMRep)](https://www.w3.org/community/reports/tdmrep/CG-FINAL-tdmrep-20240510/) recommendation for implementation examples involving EPUB 2 and PDF files.
  - Include a written statement regarding the publisher's TDM policy on the copyright page to ensure the policy is clear to both human readers and automated systems.
Controle:
  - Check for the `tdm:reservation` and `tdm:policy` metadata and ensure they match the statements provided on the copyright page.
