title: Book data usage and search conditions are indicated
abstract: Text and Data Exploration (TDM) techniques are used by private and public entities to analyze large amounts of data, including copyrighted content such as digital books. Use of these techniques may be subject to different legal conditions, and their mass exploitation requires rapid identification of works for which TDM techniques are not authorized by rightholders.

objectif:
  - Notify machines of authorization or prohibition of the operation of book data by TDM techniques
Meo:
  - "For an EPUB3 for which you want to grant TDM permissions, add `tdm:reservation` to the OPF file. If you have a license that can be accessed, you can provide the address with the `tdm:policy` metric. "
  - Other techniques exist for EPUB2 and PDF files. Examples of implementation are available on the recommendation [TDM Reservation Protocol (TDMRep), in English](https://www.w3.org/community/reports/tdmrep/CG-FINAL-tdmrep-20240510/)
  - To remove any ambiguity and make your policy known to humans as well as machines, it is advisable to add a written mention of your TDM policy to the copyright page
Controle:
  - Check the presence of the metrics `tdm:reservation` and `tdm:policy` as well as the mention on the copyright page.
