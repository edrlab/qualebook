title: "Conditions for the exploitation and mining of book data are indicated"
abstract: "Text and Data Mining (TDM) practices are used by private and public entities to analyze large amounts of data, including copyrighted content such as digital books. The use of these techniques may be subject to different legal conditions, and their mass exploitation requires rapid identification of works for which TDM techniques are not authorized by rights holders."

objectif:
  - "Inform machines of the authorization or prohibition of the exploitation of book data by TDM techniques."
Meo:
  - "For an EPUB3 file where TDM rights are reserved, add the `tdm:reservation` metadata to the OPF file."
  - "For an EPUB3 consultable license, its address can be provided using the `tdm:policy metadata`."
  - "Other techniques exist for EPUB2 and PDF files. Examples of implementation are available in the recommendation [TDM Reservation Protocol (TDMRep), in English](https://www.w3.org/community/reports/tdmrep/CG-FINAL-tdmrep-20240510/)."
  - "To remove any ambiguity and make the policy known to humans as well as machines, it is advisable to add a written statement regarding the TDM policy to the copyright page."
Controle:
  - "Check the presence of the `tdm:reservation` and `tdm:policy` metadata as well as the corresponding statements on the copyright page."
