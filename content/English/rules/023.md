title: "Each image acting as a link has a text alternative describing its function"
abstract: "Images may have a url pointing the reader to a new page, in which case the destination of the link must be indicated. A common use case is a publisher's logo serving as a link to their website. Other examples include a license badge pointing to the license page, or a QR code leading to an online resource."
