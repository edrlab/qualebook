title: "The ebook version number is indicated" 
abstract: "To ensure traceability and allow precise identification of which ebook version is being accessed, it is essential to clearly indicate the file version number. This information is particularly important in the event of corrections, updates, or errata, allowing different versions of the same work to be distinguished while retaining the same primary identifier."
