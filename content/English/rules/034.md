Consequently, all phone numbers must include their international country codes to ensure they work correctly (especially in travel guides, directories, international manuals, professional books, or general contact information included in the text)."

Meo:
  - "Start each phone number with the country code with two previous digits of one more symbol, e.g. '+33' for France. Replace the zero, which may appear as the first digit, with the country code. "
  - "Format the phone number as a sequence of digit pairs separated by non-breaking spaces, where the first group is the country code (starting with '+') and the second group contains the single area digit, to harmonize the layout. For example, '+33 1 00 00 00 00'"
Controle:
  - "For each phone number: <ul><li>Verify that it starts with the two-digit country code preceded by a plus sign (e.g., '+33' for France).</li><li>Verify that the leading zero has been replaced by the country code.</li><li>Verify that the overall format consists of digit pairs separated by non-breaking spaces, where the first pair is the country code (starting with '+') and the second pair contains a single digit. For example, '+33 1 00 00 00 00'</li></ul>."
