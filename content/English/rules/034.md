detail: null
abstract: The digital book, regardless of its language of writing, is a searchable, downloadable and shared object from any point in the world. It goes without saying that all phone numbers mentioned in it must carry their international codes for the contact to be established without fault (especially in the case of travel guide, directory, international manual, professional book, or more generally contact information included in the body of the digital book).
