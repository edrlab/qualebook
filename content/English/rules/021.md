Rubrique: Identification and contact
title: If the digital book establishes one or more standards or references, a link is offered to each of them.
abstract: Your partners, distributors, regulators, or even libraries, collect thousands of a digital book that must be sorted, organized and controlled. Do not force them to spend hours checking each assertion, offer them instant access to all the necessary evidence in one click! This facilitates the work of the entire book chain, from distributor to authority, through sales platforms and bibliotheques, but it also ensures the transparency and creativeness of the book. So, stand out and let the links do the work for you, ensuring that each digital book meets the established standards!
