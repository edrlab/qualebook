title: "Reserve underlining for links."
abstract: "Web conventions have established a strong association between underlined text and hyperlinks. Underlining content that is not a link risks causing user confusion and frustrating, unnecessary clicks. This rule does not mandate that all links must be underlined, but rather ensures that underlining is not misused for non-interactive text."
