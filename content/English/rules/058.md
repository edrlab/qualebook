objectif:
  - Allow reader content to be understood if reader/reader software does not apply style sheets embedded in the digital book or if access mode is not visual.
  - Improve accessibility of content to readers with disabilities.
Meo:
  - "We will ensure that content in HTML files (i. e. Structure tags&nbsp;: h1, h2, p, and semantics&nbsp;: em, strongâ€¦), to present them in the same order and with the same sense with or without CSS formatting."
Controle:
  - Use ACE to check the logical structure of the content ("Structures" tab of the ACE report).
  - Make sure content stays readable, e.g. in the case of a transparent HTML image whose readability depends on the background color applied with the background-color property
