title: "Navigation is done in predictable order"
abstract: "There are several options for navigating a digital book: for example from page to page by pressing a button or to a specific location on the screen; from one paragraph to another using the tab key on the keyboard; from one chapter to another via the table of contents of the application or the book itself... To ensure reading comfort, it is necessary to make possible all these means of access."
