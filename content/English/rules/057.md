Controle:
  - "Either upstream (at the time of the design of the digital book)&nbsp;: Repeating contents whose contrast/luminosite<unk> difference with their background is potentially insufficient; Use a tool like Colour Contrast Analyzer to calculate the contrast ratio&nbsp;: click on LuminoSitee and raise the color of the foreground and then that of the second plane in the defined fields; Make sure the contrast ratio is higher or equal to 3:1"
  - "Either downstream&nbsp;: Use ACE and its error report. Please check the case in the \"Errors\" tab and search for \"color-contract\". Follow the procedure described above. "
