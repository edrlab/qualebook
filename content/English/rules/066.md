objectif:
  - Enable users to copy and paste content without preserving decorative uppercase formatting.
  - Allow users with reading difficulties to customize the display of text that appears in all caps.
Meo:
  - Enter HTML content following standard typographic rules for capitalization (e.g., sentence beginnings, proper nouns).
  - 'Use the CSS property "text-transform: uppercase" for decorative styling.'
Controle:
  - Copy the uppercase text and paste it into a plain text editor; decoratively styled text should revert to its original case.
  - Verify that capitalization in the source code follows standard language conventions (e.g., acronyms or bibliographic entries may remain in uppercase).
