objectif:
  - Improve text readability.
  - Provide semantic structure to list content.
Meo:
  - Use <ul> for unordered lists and <ol> for ordered lists to wrap list content, and use <li> for each list item. Use CSS to define the visual appearance of bullets or numbering.
  - Mark up description or definition lists using the <dl>, <dt>, and <dd> tags.
Controle:
  - Inspect the HTML source code of the EPUB. Verify that all lists are wrapped in <ul>, <ol>, or <dl> tags and that each item is contained within the corresponding <li>, <dt>, or <dd> tags.
