title: "Style sheets are minified"
abstract: "Minification involves reducing data volume and file size by removing elements that reading systems do not require, such as whitespace, line breaks, and comments. Minified CSS files save bandwidth, which results in faster loading times and reduces the energy consumption associated with data transfer and rendering."
