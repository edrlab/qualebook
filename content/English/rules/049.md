title: Downloading file language is specified when it differs from the original page language
abstract: "Specify the language of the files for download, is like putting indicators in a digital library: it makes it easy for everyone to find what they are looking for, without any nasty surprises. Imagine clicking on a link thinking of getting a document in French and falling on a text in English - it's a bit like ordering a crescent and getting a burrito instead! By clearly indicating the language of the files, you make your book more welcoming and easy to use. This is a small attention that makes a big difference, a bit like a good hote that makes sure that every invitee finds what he is looking for without getting lost in a linguistic labyrinth. So please your users and avoid language surprises â€“ always make the file language download!"
