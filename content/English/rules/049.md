title: "Downloading file language is specified when it differs from the original page language"
abstract: "Specify the language of the files for download, is like putting indicators in a digital library: it makes it easy for everyone to find what they are looking for, without any nasty surprises. Imagine clicking a link expecting a document in French and getting a text in English—it's a bit like ordering a croissant and receiving a burrito instead! By clearly indicating the language of the files, you make your book more welcoming and easy to use. It is a small detail that makes a big difference, much like a good host ensuring every guest finds what they need without getting lost in a linguistic maze. So please your users and avoid language surprises – always make the file language download!"
