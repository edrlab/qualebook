title: "If a glossary, lexicon, bibliography or index exists, they are identified as such and available as navigational references"
abstract: "Seemally identify appendices (glossaries, indexes, bibliographies, etc. and integrate them to the navigation repeats (`landmarks`) is essential to allow quick access and effective exploitation by assistive technologies."

objectif:
  - "Guarantee intuitive and quick navigation to key appendices (glossary, index, bibliography)."
  - "Strengthen semantic accessibility and information discovery for all readers, including those using assistive technologies."
  - "Improve the overall usability of the digital work by allowing efficient access to definitions and references."
Meo:
  - "In the `nav.xhtml` file, create a specific navigation section for landmarks using the `<nav>` tag with the `epub:type` `landmarks` attribute. Inside this `<nav>` tag, list the links to the different key sections of your book. Each link (`<a>`) must have an `epub:type` attribute which identifies the semantic nature of the section it points to. The relevant epub:types for this rule are `glossary`, `index`, `bibliography`"
  - "Alongside these epub:type in the navigation, and to reinforce semantics and accessibility, the HTML element which contains the glossary, index or bibliography (inleurs fichiers XHTML respectifs) doit également se voir attribuer le rôle ARIA DPub correspondant, soit `doc-glossary`, `doc-index`, `doc-bibliography`"
  - "It is also possible to provide a mechanism such as a *tooltip*allowing the user to access the definition of technical or sectoral vocabulary terms, from at least their first occurrence in each portion of the book."
Controle:
  - "If a glossary, lexicon, bibliography or index exists, then check for the presence of corresponding reference points in the navigation panel of a reading system."
  - "The presence of ARIA roles can be verified in the ACE report, by checking the code, or by testing with assistive technology that renders this information."

notes:
  - "In some cases, the index can be complicated to create due to the number of links to create. It can then be removed from the digital version. It may also be seen as less useful than research."
  - "Please note, some ingestion systems impose linearity in the elements of the summary."
