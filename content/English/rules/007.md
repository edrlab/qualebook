objectif:
  - Ensure intuitive and rapid navigation to key sections such as glossaries, indexes, and bibliographies.
  - Strengthen semantic accessibility and information discovery for all users, including those using assistive technologies.
  - Improve the overall usability of the digital publication by providing efficient access to definitions and references.
Meo:
  - In the `nav.xhtml` file, create a dedicated navigation section for landmarks using a `<nav>` tag with the `epub:type="landmarks"` attribute. Inside this tag, list links to the book's key sections. Each link (`<a>`) must have an `epub:type` attribute that semantically identifies the destination (e.g., `glossary`, `index`, `bibliography`).
  - Assign the corresponding DPub ARIA role (`doc-glossary`, `doc-index`, or `doc-bibliography`) to the HTML element containing the content in its respective XHTML file, in addition to using the `epub:type` attributes in the navigation document.
  - Consider providing a mechanism, such as a tooltip, to display definitions for technical or specialized terms, starting at least from their first occurrence in each section of the book.
Controle:
  - Verify that any existing glossaries, bibliographies, or indexes appear as corresponding landmarks in the reading system's navigation panel.
  - Confirm the presence of appropriate ARIA roles by reviewing the ACE report, inspecting the source code, or testing with assistive technology.

notes:
  - "In some cases, the index can be complicated to create due to the number of links to create. It can then be removed from the digital version. It may also be seen as less useful than research."
  - "Please note, some ingestion systems impose linearity in the elements of the summary."
