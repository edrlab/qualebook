objectif:
  - Help users identify previously visited content.
  - Help users identify content yet to be explored.
  - Encourage the discovery of new content.
Meo:
  - Do not apply the same CSS styles to unvisited links (a or a:link selectors) and visited links (a:visited selector).
Controle:
  - For each page containing links, check if a specific style is applied to visited links to visually distinguish them from unvisited links.
  - If no specific style is defined in the document, ensure that the reading system's default style still clearly identifies visited links.
