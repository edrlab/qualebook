objectif:
  - "Help users identify content they have already visited."

  - "Encourage the discovery of new content"
Meo:
  - "Do not apply the same CSS styles by default for unvisited links (readers a or a:link) and for visited links (reader a:visited). "
Controle:
  - For each page that contains links, check whether a specific style is applied to links that have already been visited, so that they can be visually distinguished from links that have not been visited.
  - If there is no specific style in the document, ensure that the default style of the reading system still allows visited links to be clearly identified.
