title: "Country is accurate for all mailing addresses"
abstract: "Your readers do not know in which country you are in, especially in an international context. By specifying the country associated with your mailing address (e.g. social size), you adapt your communication to a global audience, which makes the information more comprehensible and usable. Cette clarté est d'autant plus importante dans les cas de guide de voyage, d'annuaire, de manuel international, ou de livre professionnel."
