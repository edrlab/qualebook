title: Country is accurate for all mailing addresses
detail: null
abstract: Your readers do not know in which country you are in, especially in an international context. By specifying the country associated with your mailing address (e.g. social size), you adapt your communication to a global audience, which makes the information more comprehensible and usable. This clarity is all the more important in travel guides, directories, international manuals or professional books.
