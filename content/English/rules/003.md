title: "The source code of each book section includes metadata describing its content"
abstract: "Digital books are split into individual resources, generally representing specific portions of the work (a page, a chapter, etc.), known as `Content Documents`. Each resource file must include metadata in its source code to describe it or provide information about it. This is the description metadata which, as its name implies, describes the page."
