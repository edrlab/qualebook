title: The source code of each part or portion of the book contains a metadata that describes the content of the book
abstract: Digital books are cut into individual resources called *Content Document*. This decoupage represents the representation of specific editorial portions (one page, one chapter, etc. ). Each of these resources is contained in a file and must contain information in the source code to describe it or provide information about it. This reference relates to the metadata which, as its name indicates, allows to describe the page.
