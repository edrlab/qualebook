objectif:
  - "Enable access to information for those whose reading tools, assistive technologies, or disabilities (such as color blindness) prevent them from distinguishing colors."
  - "Enhance content accessibility for individuals with disabilities."

Controle:
  - "Compare visually two display types: a normal display and a monochrome display with colors disabled."
