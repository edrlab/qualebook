  - "Ensure information is accessible to users who cannot distinguish colors due to their device settings, reading software, or visual impairments (such as color blindness)"
  - "Improve content accessibility for people with disabilities"
Meo:
  - "Supplement color with a secondary indicator to convey the information. This complementary, independent of the CSS formatting layer, can be multiple orders, e.g.&nbsp;: <ul><li>Prevent semantic markup (strong, em, etc. ;</li><li>Add axes, patterns, borders, etc. in maps and charts.</li></ul>"
