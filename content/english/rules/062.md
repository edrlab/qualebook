objectif: ["Facilitate the adaptation of the rendering to the media (mobile or other) or to the user's needs (enlargement of character size, modification of colors, font, weight, justification, etc.).", "Improve the accessibility of content to people with disabilities.", "Improve the consideration of content by search engines specific to reading software."]
Meo: ["Use HTML texts formatted using CSS styles (and in particular downloadable fonts or Web fonts)"]
Controle: ["This verification requires visual examination of the pages to identify images containing only text and to assess whether formatting via CSS would have produced an equivalent rendering. For each page containing texts set in images:
Review the images (HTML images and possible CSS background images used to simulate a particular texture: parchment, notebook sheet, etc.).
Check that texts placed in images only correspond to formatting that cannot be obtained via CSS styles.
Excluded from this requirement: logos, promotional graphic elements.
