detail: The international dialing code is available for all telephone numbers
abstract: "The digital book, whatever its language of writing, is an object that can be consulted, downloaded and shared from any point on the globe. It therefore goes without saying that all telephone numbers mentioned there must bear their international codes, so that contact is established without fail (particularly in the case of travel guides, directories, international manuals, professional books , or more generally contact information included in the body of the digital book)."

Meo: ["Start each phone number with the two-digit country code preceded by a plus symbol, for example &#34;+33&#34; for France. Replace the zero, which may appear as the first digit, with the country code. Present the telephone number as a series of pairs of numbers separated by a non-breaking space, where the first pair, corresponding to the country code, begins with a plus symbol, and the second pair contains only a figure, to harmonize the rest. For example, &#34;+33 1 00 00 00 00&#34;."]
