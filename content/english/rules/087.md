title: Content Documents files respect the weight limit of older Reading Systems. 
abstract: "Although not an official requirement of EPUB2, it is recommended not to exceed 300 kilobytes for XHTML files. This limitation is due to an old version of the Adobe Mobile Reader engine that could not handle larger files. If the XHTML file size exceeded 300 kilobytes, content beyond this limit was not displayed."
