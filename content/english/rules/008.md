title: Each graph is accompanied by its numerical data
abstract: A picture is often worth more than a long speech. Certainly, but first of all, it can be difficult to truly understand a graph (curve, diagram, histogram, pie chart, etc.) if you do not have the data that allowed it to be created. On the other hand, some users will not be able to access the graphic rendering, and access to the data will allow them to understand the content.
