Meo: ["Use intrinsic fallback mechanisms (such as those available for the [html] object and canvas elements) or, when an intrinsic fallback is not applicable, by using a manifest-level fallback. Fallback chains are created using the fallback attribute on manifest item elements. This attribute references the ID [xml] of another manifest item that is a fallback for the current item. "]
