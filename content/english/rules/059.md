Meo: ["When content is designated in the physical version of the book by a reference to its form or its position, the information in the digital version of the same work must also be available by a textual mention including a hyperlink."]
Controle: ["This verification concerns a wide variety of potential cases, particularly in the flow of a text where reference is made to an illustration, a graph or a table. For each content concerned, it must be ensured that references to its form or position on the screen are not the only means of identifying it. We will then use an explicit reference to an identifier (example “See figure n°1”), a link to an anchor, etc."]
