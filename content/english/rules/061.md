title: The size of the clickable elements is sufficient. 
abstract: Touch screens brought their share of constraints. Not the least of these is being able to click with your fingers without difficulty. It turns out that international standards for accessibility of web content to people with disabilities even specify a numerical value for the minimum size of clickable elements. As in the case of contrasts, this allows us to propose a rule which is based on the existence of this numerical value.
