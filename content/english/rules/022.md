title: "Each decorative image is tagged as it is"
abstract: "Digital book reading devices often allow synthetic voice reproduction and some users with disabilities use screen readers to obtain alternative audio or tactile reproduction. In these two cases, textual alternatives to the images are reproduced, which can confuse understanding or become annoying in the case of images for decorative purposes. To avoid making the reading cumbersome, it is necessary to correctly inform the decorative function."
