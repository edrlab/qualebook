detail: The main language of the target page of a link is identifiable when it differs from that of the original page.
abstract: Arriving by surprise on a section in the dialect of the Ñoldor Elves when you don't speak their language is never very pleasant. In an e-book, it is important to provide clear information so the reader knows what to expect when they click on a link, whether internal or external. Identifying the language of the target section or content in advance helps avoid surprises and improves the reading experience. Specifying the language of the sections in the links helps to limit unnecessary or frustrating clicks for readers.

objectif: ["Allow readers and reading tools, particularly text-to-speech tools, to anticipate a language change when navigating a digital book.", "
Prevent readers from accessing a section or content whose language they do not understand, by clearly indicating the target language in advance."]
Meo: ["The target language of a link can be indicated in several ways:

*Via the wording of the link, written in the target language, which allows the reader to anticipate the language change
*Optionally using an appropriate icon, such as a symbol or visual indicator (such as a flag), although the use of icons is less common in digital books and may depend on the context of publication page.
*Possibly explicitly in the wording of the link or in its immediate context, by clearly mentioning the target language directly in the text or information around the link."]
Controle: ["
*Manually identify links whose target section or document content is not written in the same language as the current section.
*Check, for each of these links, that the reader is immediately informed of the language of the target content, either through the wording of the link (written in the target language), or by an appropriate visual indicator, or by an explicit indication in the context of the link."
