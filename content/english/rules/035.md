title: The country is specified for all postal addresses. 
detail: The country is specified for all postal addresses. 
abstract: Your readers may not necessarily know in which country you are located, especially in an international context. By specifying the country associated with your postal address (for example, head office), you adapt your communication to a global audience, making the information more understandable and usable. This clarity is all the more important in the case of a travel guide, directory, international manual, or professional book.
