Landmarks are key places in a publication that a user is likely to want to access quickly. They include table of contents, glossaries, bibliographies and other navigation and information aids.

Both ARIA and EPUB define methods for expressing landmarks:
* ARIA landmarks are expressed using the attibute role and exist only in the document in which they are defined (see ARIA landmarks for more information).
* EPUB uses a special navigation aid in the navigation document to define where landmarks are located, as they are usually spread across many documents (see EPUB landmarks for more information).
See [EPUB 3.3 section 7.4.4 The landmarks nav element](https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-33/#sec-nav-landmarks)

An EPUB content document is a publication resource referenced from the spine or a manifest fallback chain that conforms to either the XHTML or SVG content document definitions.

EPUB content documents contain all or part of the content of an EPUB publication (i.e., the textual, visual and/or audio content).

See [EPUB 3.3 section 6. EPUB content documents](https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-33/#sec-contentdocs).
