*Work in progress*

Digital publishing has developed appropriate industrialization and standardization processes, such as the EPUB format, but is not immune to external injunctions linked to legal provisions and societal issues. 

To remain profitable while meeting the expectations of audiences and funders, publishing houses need to acquire a wide range of skills. Digital production teams cannot confine themselves to typography, performance, interoperability, accessibility, eco-design, security or personal data management. It is imperative to coordinate these diverse areas of expertise.

All digital publishing professions are involved, and the challenges are in terms of decision-making, risk management, training, methods, resources and governance.  To integrate and assimilate diverse outside expertise, digital publishing needs to equip itself with quality assurance, management and control tools for design, production and distribution, as well as for training and skills certification. 

Digital book quality control lists aim to&#8239;:

* ensure access to digital books for as many readers as possible, without discrimination as to age, skills, physical or mental aptitudes, culture, equipment or access methods;
* build a common quality reference framework for digital books
* to facilitate the appropriation of digital books by professionals and give meaning to the actions undertaken; 

This work is based on the [Opquast Web Quality Assurance Checklist](https://checklists.opquast.com/en/web-quality-assurance/), 240 rules to improve your sites and take better care of your users - Version 4 - 2020-2025.
